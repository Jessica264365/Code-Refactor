Refactoring a Webpage Homework #1

For this assignment I was given a webpage to refactor. My goal was to make the code more streamlined while also making the webpage cohesive with accessibility standards. The first thing I did with this assignment was make the HTML semantic. There were a lot of non semantic elements throughout the entire HTML. I replaced these tags with tags that made more sense and gave structure to the webpage. Next I added alt tags to all of the images on the page. I wanted to make every image accessibile so people visiting the page could really get the full affect of it whether they had a disabilty or not. I decided to move the banner image from the CSS to the HTML so I could give it an alt tag. To me this image struck me more as a banner rather than a background image. I felt that it needed an alt tag as well because it seemed important to the overall message of the page. The last thing I did was move on to the CSS. There were a lot of reptative CSS sections. I combined these to streamline the CSS and made the class names either "section-blocks" or "side-bar". This made it easy to pick out the exact part of the page that each CSS element was contributing to.
